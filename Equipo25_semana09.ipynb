Mi hija (ahora de 17 meses) ha podido quitarlo desde que lo recibió hace 3 meses. Pero creo que ninguna succión sería lo suficientemente fuerte para un niño decidido que quiere quitar su plato de la bandeja.\n",

            "Comentario 3: Compramos estos juguetes cuando nuestro hijo tenía 15 meses, pero nunca les prestó atención hasta que tuvo casi 20 meses, cuando lo llevamos al parque con un arenero enorme. Pero ahora lo usa principalmente en la bañera, ya que le encanta llenar las tazas y ver cómo se vacía. Nunca lo ha usado como un juguete de apilar porque tiene muchos otros, pero puedo verlo haciendo una pila con estos. Barato y bueno.\n",

            "Comentario 4: La habitación de mi hija está decorada con un tema de búhos. Después de buscar, no pude encontrar un juego de ropa de cama para cuna que me gustara. En cambio, opté por este juego de cama para niños pequeños y estoy tan contenta de haberlo hecho. Es de buena calidad, adorable y durará años, no solo unos pocos meses como un juego de cama para cuna. También tenemos algunos de los accesorios a juego y recibimos muchos cumplidos por todo el conjunto. ¡Definitivamente contenta con esta compra! \n",
            "\n",
            "Comentario 5: Estos chupetes están bien y no tengo ninguna queja importante. Los compré porque vienen con la cubierta de esterilización, pero desde entonces he aprendido que el jabón y el agua son perfectamente válidos para la esterilización, siempre y cuando no se use agua de pozo. Así que ya no uso la cubierta para esterilizar, solo para cubrirla y mantenerla limpia. Por lo tanto, sería más útil si hubiera una cubierta para cada chupete. Además, mi bebé tiene las mejillas gordas y estos chupetes son bastante anchos, por lo que presionan sus mejillas. Parece que no le importa, pero sí hace que sean un poco más difíciles de mantener en su boca y le quedan unas horribles marcas rojas en las mejillas. Así que prefiero todos sus otros chupetes a estos. Pero estos también están bastante bien.\n",

            "Comentario 6: Compramos dos de estos, uno para la habitación del bebé y otro para la cocina. Se ajusta perfectamente a nuestras botellas anchas Dr. Browns. No es demasiado ruidoso. Parece calentar las botellas en un tiempo razonable. No estoy seguro de lo que esperan las personas que se quejan del tiempo de un calentador de agua. ¡No es un microondas! \n",

            "Comentario 9: Gran bolso con mucho espacio para toda la comida de mi hijo. Mantiene la comida fría con una bolsa de hielo. El broche en la parte superior facilita su sujeción a un cochecito o a una bolsa más grande. El divertido diseño recibe cumplidos. \n",
            "\n",
            "Comentario 10: Compré estos al mismo tiempo que compré mi Boba, así que los puse antes de probar el portabebés con mi bebé por primera vez. En el momento en que lo puse en el portabebés, comenzó a masticar estos protectores para la dentición. Si no los hubiera puesto, habría estado mordiendo directamente el portabebés. Las instrucciones del portabebés dicen que no se debe poner directamente en la lavadora, así que me siento mucho mejor sabiendo que estaba mordiendo los protectores (que lavé primero con detergente para bebés). Además, compré algunos juegos adicionales para que si está en el portabebés por un período de tiempo prolongado y los protectores se mojan mucho, pueda cambiarlos fácilmente. Diría que estos son imprescindibles para tu portabebés mientras tu bebé está en etapa de dentición o para los bebés a los que les gusta masticar.\n",

        "Al comparar ambos modelos para la traducción de inglés a español, el modelo transformer preentrenado puede ser preferible para aplicaciones donde la eficiencia y el costo son críticos y donde los textos no requieren una adaptabilidad extrema. Por otro lado, un LLM como Gemini podría ser más adecuado para entornos donde la calidad de la traducción y la capacidad de adaptarse a diferentes estilos y contextos son más importantes, a pesar de su mayor costo y complejidad operativa.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cada modelo tiene sus ventajas y desventajas dependiendo de las necesidades específicas del proyecto y los recursos disponibles. La elección entre uno u otro dependerá de estos factores, así como de las prioridades del usuario o la organización."
